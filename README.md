# R-Based Analysis of Communication Differences Between Autistic and Non-autistic Adults

This project explores how autistic and non-autistic adults interact with someone of the same or a different neurotype, focusing on verbal engagement and backchanneling. It was completed as part of my Neuroscience Honours year at the University of Edinburgh.

## 📚 Project Summary

I analysed short, task-based conversations between three dyad types: autistic–autistic, non-autistic–non-autistic, and mixed. I annotated each conversation for verbal backchanneling (e.g. “yeah”, “mhm”) and engagement, then merged this with self-reported rapport data. Analyses were conducted in R.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Non-autistic adults engage and backchannel more with other non-autistic adults, and report a higher rapport in those interactions.
- Engagement and backchanneling slightly improve rapport, but the effect is small.
- Autistic–autistic pairs report stronger rapport despite similar engagement and backchanneling levels to mixed pairs.
- What drives connection for autistic adults remains unclear — future research could explore unstructured, non-task-based interaction.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **ELAN** for behavioural annotation  
- **R** for data wrangling, assumption checking, and statistical analysis (ANOVA, regression, Fisher’s Exact, permutation test)  
- **ggplot2** for visualisation
